/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for UPI Linker App
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only access their own profile data and payment requests.
 * @data_structure User data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, and each user's payment requests are stored under `/users/{userId}/paymentRequests/{paymentRequestId}`.
 * @key_security_decisions User listing is disallowed for privacy. Path-based ownership is enforced for all data access.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization No denormalization is needed because path-based ownership is enforced.
